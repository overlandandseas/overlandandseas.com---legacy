        <p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the very beginning of 2017 when I found out about lil peep (the &ldquo;girls&rdquo; music video to be exact). This revival of music I listened to in High School like samples from Funeral for a Friend, Senses Fail, and Brand New. Thanks to producers like nedarb and lederrick, its made this music additive to listen to, a mix of reminding how good music was a few years ago and also seeing what it has become now.</p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/319017450&amp;color=%238a9298&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true"></iframe>
        <p>It became apparent that both fans of emo/screamo and underground indie rap are one in the same. It&rsquo;s also super exciting to see new people who would not have heard of these old samples be exposed to them. Even more interesting to see them not care about where the instrumentals came from, but just be stoked for how good the overall sound is.</p>

        <p>Volumes, a band that has an incredible live show and of my favorite albums of 2014, did a song with pouya, which I almost wish had more pouya style instrumentals and a little less djent kinda beat.</p>

        <p>Every year, I put most screamo albums I find into a playlist, <a href="https://play.google.com/music/playlist/AMaBXylhWgaHm_m0swH2M8FxdPwPD9ORrq4Z7z_Qw33K9MXq4Cjmm61TWDPTT_S3r1zqLvguURCSR1BqcVeRQChCaemTsqZh7g%3D%3D">this years</a> was almost lackluster because I was listening to other types mostly throughout the year, you can even see I started stretching what it means to be screamo, as I have been since  <a href="https://play.google.com/music/playlist/AMaBXynC6Id_YluRCO1BLJJzAr6wkgMid0ETyRsKrivP3gh3j1dKrF6EMFYh4P2vyM_t3kgKdKFORNIYU9JI0zJFYGdVaa1RAQ%3D%3D">2014</a> when I started doing these. There were a few standouts this year such as Palisades Self Titled album, The White Noise: AM/PM, and Hundredth with a complete change in sound that really brought out something new.</p>

        <p>Maybe it&rsquo;s my taste changing, but 2018 I&rsquo;m more looking forward to seeing artists like Lil Lotus, Nothing,nowhere, and lil Aaron who are clearly wearing their emo inspirations on their sleeves(literally), grow and watch them gain in popularity.</p>
